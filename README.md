# odin-recipes

For this project, I'm going to practice my HTML knowledge I've learned from The Odin Project. 

I'm going to create a basic recipe webpage.

It will consiwst of a main index page that will hold some recipes.

# This website will not look pretty at first, so if you've stumbled upon this repo, I'm sorry.

I will revist this to make it look nicer but, this is from my own practice with git and HTML.
